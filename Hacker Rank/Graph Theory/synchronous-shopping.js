/**
 * Determine the total travel time for the cats to purchase all of the types of fish,
 * finally meeting at shopping center n.
 * [problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/synchronous-shopping/problem)
 *
 * @example
 * shop(5, 5, ['1 1', '1 2', '1 3', '1 4', '1 5'],
 * [[1, 2, 10],[1, 3, 10],[2, 4, 10],[3, 5, 10],[4, 5, 10]]);
 * //30
 *
 * @param {number} n - an integer, the number of shopping centers
 * @param {number} k - an integer, the number of types of fish
 * @param {string[]} centers - an array of strings of space-separated integers
 *                 where the first integer of each element is the number
 *                 of types of fish sold at a center and the remainder are the types sold
 * @param {number[][]} roads - a 2-dimensional array of integers where the first two values
 *                            are the shopping centers connected by the bi-directional road,
 *                            and the third is the travel time for that road
 * @return {number} time - an integer that represents the minimum time required for the shopping
